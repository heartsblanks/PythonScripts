Certainly! Here's a simple example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `python-nexus` library to check the connection to a Nexus repository:

```python
from nexus import NexusClient

# Create a Nexus client instance
nexus_client = NexusClient(base_url="https://your.repository.url", username="your_username", password="your_password")

try:
    # Attempt to authenticate and check the connection
    nexus_client.authenticate()
    print("Connection to Nexus repository successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Connection to Nexus repository failed: {e}")
```

Replace `"https://your.repository.url"` with the actual URL of your Nexus repository, and provide your Nexus username and password in the `username` and `password` parameters.

This code will try to authenticate with the Nexus repository using the provided credentials. If the connection is successful, it will print a success message. If there's an issue with the connection, it will print an error message with the details of the exception.
